#
# hosts.deny	This file contains access rules which are used to
#		deny connections to network services that either use
#		the tcp_wrappers library or that have been
#		started through a tcp_wrappers-enabled xinetd.
#
#		The rules in this file can also be set up in
#		/etc/hosts.allow with a 'deny' option instead.
#
#		See 'man 5 hosts_options' and 'man 5 hosts_access'
#		for information on rule syntax.
#		See 'man tcpd' for information on tcp_wrappers
