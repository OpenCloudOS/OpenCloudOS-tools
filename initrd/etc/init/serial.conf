# Automatically start a configured serial console
#
# How this works:
#
# On boot, a udev helper examines /dev/console. If a serial console is the
# primary console (last console on the commandline in grub),  the event
# 'fedora.serial-console-available <port name> <speed>' is emitted, which
# triggers this script. It waits for the runlevel to finish, ensures
# the proper port is in /etc/securetty, and starts the getty.
#
# If your serial console is not the primary console, or you want a getty
# on serial even if it's not the console, create your own event by copying
# /etc/init/tty.conf, and changing the getty line in that file.

start on fedora.serial-console-available DEV=* and stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[2345]
