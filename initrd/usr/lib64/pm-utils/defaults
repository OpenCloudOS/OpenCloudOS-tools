# Default method to power down the system when hibernating.
# If commented out, the system will use the kernel default as a 
# default value.

# Check /sys/power/disk for valid values.  The default value
# will be surrounded by [square brackets].
# HIBERNATE_MODE="shutdown"

# Whether we need to post the video card when resuming from
# hibernate. You should not normally need to set this.  
# In the future pm-utils will get this setting from HAL.
#
# Valid values are "no" and "yes"
# HIBERNATE_RESUME_POST_VIDEO="no"

# The default sleep/wake system to use.  Valid values are:
#   kernel    The built-in kernel suspend/resume support.
#             Use this if nothing else is supported on your system.
#   uswsusp   If your system has support for the userspace
#             suspend programs (s2ram/s2disk/s2both), then use this.
#   tuxonice  If your system has support for tuxonice, use this.
#
# The system defaults to "kernel" if this is commented out.
# SLEEP_MODULE="kernel"

# These variables will be handled specially when we load files in

# If you need to unload any modules to suspend/resume, add them here.

# If you want to keep hooks from running, add their names  here.
# HOOK_BLACKLIST=""

# If you want to unconditionally add parameters to the commandline,
# add them here.

# If you want to ignore commandline parameters, add them here.

# If you need to synchronize the system clock across a suspend/resume or
# hibernate/thaw cycle, set this variable.
