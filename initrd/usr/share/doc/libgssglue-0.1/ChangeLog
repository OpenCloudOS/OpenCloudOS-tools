	Release 0.1 (of libgssglue)
	* ****************************************
	  ***** RENAME library to libgssglue *****
	  ****************************************
	* Rename library from libgssapi to libgssglue to
	  resolve conflicts with Heimdal and MIT libraries
	  named libgssapi.
	* Patch from Luke Howard <lukeh@novell.com> to allow
	  application to continue to "function" even if no
	  mechanisms are correctly configured.

2007-04-20: kwc
	Release 0.11
	Changes since libgssapi-0.10:
	- Add glue routine for gss_krb5_ccache_name.  Needed
	  to work with Heimdal.  (Need Heimdal 0.8.1 or later
	  which has versioned symbols, which prevents glue
	  functions from calling the wrong function.)
2006-06-22: kwc
	Release 0.10
	Changes since libgssapi-0.9:
	- Add symbol versioning script and use it when linking
	  the library.  This allows us to use the gss_* symbols
	  from MIT gssapi_krb5 libraries without namespace
	  collision problems.  This is required for use with
	  MIT release 1.5 which no longer exports the krb5_gss_*
	  symbols.  (In addition, this should also allow us to
	  work with Heimdal. Currently untested.)
	- Remove code that tries to get symbols with names krb5_gss_*.
	- Open dynamic libraries with RTLD_LOCAL

2006-04-08: kwc
	Release 0.9
	Changes since libgssapi-0.8:
	- Correct declaration and implementation of
	  gss_export_lucid_sec_context(). This results in an
	  interface change.  The soname is updated to reflect this.

2006-04-01: kwc
	Release 0.8
	Changes since librpcsecgss-0.7:
	- Memory leak: free union_name in gss_acquire_cred if
	  it was allocated there.
	- Don't exit() the application if initialization fails,
	  just fail the operation.
	- Add glue routines for gss_canonicalize_name and
	  gss_export_name
	- Make "first-class" routines for gss_get_mic,
	  gss_verify_mic, gss_wrap, and gss_unwrap
	- Clean up some clutter of unused #ifde'd code
	- Patch from Timo Aaltonen <tjaalton@cc.hut.fi> for
	  Debian packaging.
	- Change union_name definition such that external_name
	  is a gss_buffer_desc rather than gss_buffer_t.
	  Eliminates unnecessary malloc'ing and freeing.

2005-12-16: kwc
	Release 0.7
	Changes since librpcsecgss-0.6:
	- A patch from Olaf Kirch <okir@suse.de> to
	  gss_inquire_cred() to remove a potential
	  problem of an uninitialized variable and to return
	  an error if generic_gss_copy_oid() fails.
	- Revert a bad change made to gss_free_lucid_sec_context().
	- Clean up some compiler warnings

2005-12-07: kwc
	Release 0.6
	Changes since librpcsecgss-0.5:
	- Generate gssapi.h using system information
	- Install gssapi.h in addition to the library
	  (Currently installed in
	  ${prefix}include/gssglue/gssapi/gssapi.h)
	- Add pkg-config support so that other packages can
	  find and use the header and library.  The pkgconfig
	  information is installed by default in
	  /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig which is not searched by
	  dedault by pkg-config.
	- Consolidate initialization code so the same code can
	  be used for MIT or Heimdal Kerberos w/o requiring
	  configure-time information of which is installed

2005-05-02: kwc
	- More configuration cleanup
	- Remove hard-coded values from gssapi.h and use
	  autoconf to get the right values for the machine
	- Building from a CVS checkout now requires that you
	  run autoheader to generarte config.h.in 

2005-03-02: kwc
	- Fix configuration issue.
	- Remove gss_release_oid() from glue layer.
