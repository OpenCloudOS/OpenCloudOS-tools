<h1>rsyslog packages</h1>
<p><b>Thanks to some volunteers, rsyslog is also available in package form on 
some distributions.</b> All currently known packages are listed below. If I have forgotten
one or if you would 
like to maintain a package for a new distribution, please mail me at
<a href="mailto:rgerhards@adiscon.com">rgerhards@adiscon.com</a>. Any help is *deeply* 
appreciated. While I create the core daemon, the package maintainers are really 
filling it with life, making it available to the average user. I am very 
grateful for that!</p>

New packages may appear at any time, so be sure to check this page whenever you 
need a new one.</p>

<li>Almost any Linux</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Bennet Todd maintains packages that should work on almost any Linux. 
He keeps a current i386 tree. There is also a PPC tree, but that one is not paid 
much attention for (anyhow, it is known to typically work well, too).
Please visit <a href="http://bent.latency.net/bent/">
http://bent.latency.net/bent/</a>, select the relevant tree and then do a search 
for rsyslog.
Please note, however, that as of this writing the versions in this repository
have been aged a bit. So it may be worth trying to find some other places first.
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Just in case you are interested, the list of distribution is sorted by alphabetic order
of the distribution name.

<p>If you do not find a suitable package for your distribution, there is no reason
to panic. It is quite simple to install rsyslog from the source tarball, so you
should consider that.
