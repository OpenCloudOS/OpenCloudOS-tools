<h1>Welcome to rsyslog</h1>
<p><b><a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/">Rsyslog</a>
is an enhanced syslogd suitable both for small systems as
well as large enterprises.</b>
<p>This page provide a few quick pointers which hopefully make your
experience with rsyslog a pleasant one. These are
<ul>
<li><b>Most importantly, the <a href="manual.html">rsyslog manual</a></b> - this points to locally
installed documentation which exactly matches the version you have installed.
It is highly suggested to at least briefly look over these files.
<li>The <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com">rsyslog web site</a> which offers
probably every information you'll ever need (ok, just kidding...).
<li>The <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc-status.html">project status page</a> provides
information on current releases
<li>and the <a href="troubleshoot.html">troubleshooting guide</a> hopefully helps if
things do not immediately work out
</ul>
<p>In general, rsyslog supports plain old syslog.conf format, except that the
config file is now called rsyslog.conf. This should help you get started
quickly.
To do the really cool things, though,
you need to learn a bit about its new features.
The man pages offer a bare minimum of information (and are still quite long). Read the 
<a href="manual.html">html documentation</a> instead.
When you change the configuration, remember to restart rsyslogd, because otherwise
it will not use your new settings (and you'll end up totally puzzled why this great
config of yours does not even work a bit...;))
