<h3>Setting up the CA</h3>
<p>The first step is to set up a certificate authority (CA). It must be 
maintained by a trustworthy person (or group) and approves the indentities of 
all machines. It does so by issuing their certificates. In a small setup, the 
administrator can provide the CA function. What is important is the the CA's

<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-3204610807458280";
/* rsyslog doc inline */
google_ad_slot = "5958614527";
google_ad_width = 125;
google_ad_height = 125;

</span>
private key is well-protocted and machine certificates are only issued if it is 
know they are valid (in a single-admin case that means the admin should not 
issue certificates to anyone else except himself).</p>
<p>The CA creates a so-called self-signed certificate. That is, it approves its 
own authenticy. This sounds useless, but the key point to understand is that 
every machine will be provided a copy of the CA's certificate. Accepting this 
certificate is a matter of trust. So by configuring the CA certificate, the 
administrator tells <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com">rsyslog</a> which certificates to trust. This is the root of all 
trust under this model. That is why the CA's private key is so important - 
everyone getting hold of it is trusted by our rsyslog instances.</p>
<center><img src="tls_cert_ca.jpg"></center>
<p>To create a self-signed certificate, use the following commands with GnuTLS (which 
is currently the only supported TLS library, what may change in the future).
Please note that GnuTLS' tools are not installed by default on many platforms. Also,
the tools do not necessarily come with the GnuTLS core package. If you do not
have certtool on your system, check if there is package for the GnuTLS tools available
(under Fedora, for example, this is named gnutls-utils-&lt;version&gt; and
it is NOT installed by default). </p>
<ol>
<li>generate the private key:
<pre>certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem</pre>
<br>
This takes a short while. Be sure to do some work on your workstation,
it waits for radom input. Switching between windows is sufficient ;)
</li>
<li>now create the (self-signed) CA certificate itself:<br>
<pre>certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem --outfile ca.pem</pre>
This generates the CA certificate. This command queries you for a
number of things. Use appropriate responses. When it comes to
certificate validity, keep in mind that you need to recreate all
certificates when this one expires. So it may be a good idea to use a
long period, eg. 3650 days (roughly 10 years). You need to specify that
the certificates belongs to an authority. The certificate is used to
sign other certificates.<br>
