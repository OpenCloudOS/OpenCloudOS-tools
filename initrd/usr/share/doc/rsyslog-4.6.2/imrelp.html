<h1>RELP Input Module</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imrelp</b></p>
<p><b>Author: Rainer Gerhards</b></p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>Provides the ability to receive syslog messages via the
reliable RELP protocol. This module requires <a href="http://www.librelp.com">librelp</a> to be
present on the system. From the user's point of view, imrelp works much
like imtcp or imgssapi, except that no message loss can occur. Please
note that with the currently supported relp protocol version, a minor
message duplication may occur if a network connection between the relp
client and relp server breaks after the client could successfully send
some messages but the server could not acknowledge them. The window of
opportunity is very slim, but in theory this is possible. Future
versions of RELP will prevent this. Please also note that rsyslogd may
lose a few messages if rsyslog is shutdown while a network conneciton
to the server is broken and could not yet be recovered. Future version
of RELP support in rsyslog will prevent that. Please note that both
scenarios also exists with plain tcp syslog. RELP, even with the small
nits outlined above, is a much more reliable solution than plain tcp
syslog and so it is highly suggested to use RELP instead of plain tcp.
Clients send messages to the RELP server via omrelp.</p>
<p><b>Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>InputRELPServerRun &lt;port&gt;<br>
Starts a RELP server on selected port</li>
</ul>
<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<ul>
<li>see description</li>
<li>To obtain the remote system's IP address, you need to have at least
librelp 1.0.0 installed. Versions below it return the hostname instead
of the IP address.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p>This sets up a RELP server on port 20514.<br>
