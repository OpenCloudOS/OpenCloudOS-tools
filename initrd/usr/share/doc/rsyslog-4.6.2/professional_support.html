<h1>Professional Services for Rsyslog</h1>
<p>Professional services are being offered by <a href="http://www.adiscon.com">Adiscon</a>, the company
that sponsors rsyslog development. For details, please contact <a href="mailto:info%40adiscon.com">Adiscon Sales</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>EMail Support Service</h3>
Price: 99.00 EURO <br>
Duration: 180 days
<br>
Support level: 8x5
<p>Purchase rsyslog support directly from the source. This
contract provides priority email support. It is a great option if you
need to provide proof of software support in your organization. This
contract provides</p>
<ul>
<li>unlimited email support tickets during validity
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">fixes for</span>
current and <span style="font-weight: bold;">past rsyslog
releases</span>
</li>
<li>advise on how to implement rsyslog in the best possible
way.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this contract, fixes for old rsyslog releases will be
provided / created, provided that it is possible to do that with the
code base in question. Phone support is not included.</p>
<h3>Custom-Written Config File</h3>
Price: 29.00 EURO
<br>
Duration: N/A
<br>
Support level: 8x5
<p>Creating rsyslog config files is easy - but if you would like
to have that extra feature and have no time to do it, this service is
for you. Important: BEFORE you purchase this service, contact us and
inquire (via <a href="mailto:info%40adiscon.com">info@adiscon.com</a>)
whether or not your desired result can be achieved via rsyslog. Once
this is clear, order the service and we will ship a custom-made
configuration file within 5 working days (at latest, most often much
faster). For security reasons, we will not put passwords into the
configuration file, but will place easy to read comments in the places
where you need to put them in. The agreement is governed under German
law. You may also purchase this service if you would like to have your
own configuration file reviewed, e.g. for auditing purposes.</p>
<h3>Local Installation Support</h3>
<p>If you intend to install rsyslog on your system but would like
to do so with minimal effort and according to your specification, you
can ask us to perform the installation for you. You get a perfect
installation, exactly like you needed, but without a need to
touch the system. This is a perfect choice for the busy administrator!
<p>In order to perform this work, we just need ssh access to your
system and the proper permissions.
<p>We charge a low one-time fee for this service. For details, please
contact <a href="mailto:info@adiscon.com">info@adiscon.com</a>.
<h3>Local Installation Maintenance</h3>
<p>If you used our services to set up the system, why not keep it
running perfectly with maintenance support? Under this contract, we 
assure you run a recent build that does not interfere with your 
environment and we even carry out change requests you may have. So this
is a hassle-free, everything cared about solution.
<p>Again, all we need to have is ssh access and the proper permissions
to your machine. Of course, work will only be carried out when you
expect us to do so. You are always in control of what happens. This
is a perfect outsourcing solution for those who would like to run
a great logging system but can not afford the time to keep it
in perfect shape!
<p>We charge a low monthly fee for this service. For details, please
contact <a href="mailto:info@adiscon.com">info@adiscon.com</a>.
<h3>Custom Development</h3>
<p>Do you need an exotic feature that otherwise would not be implemented?
Do you need something really quick, quicker than it is available via
the regular development schedule? Then, you may consider funding
development for a specific functionality. We are always looking for
interesting projects. If you hire us to to do the job, you can be sure
to get the best possible and probably quickest solution, because we are
obviously at the heart of the source code. No need to get aquainted to
anything, no risk of misunderstanding program concepts. Benefit from
our vast syslog experience.</p>
<p>Please note that custom development is not limited to rsyslog. We offer
a number of logging solutions and can also work as part of your time
for specific requirements. The opportunities are endless, just ask. We
will work with you on your requirements and provide a quote on the
estimated cost. Just write to <a href="mailto:sales@adiscon.com">sales@adiscon.com</a> for details.</p><h3>Consulting Services</h3>
<p>Do you have demanding logging requirements? Why not talk to a
real&nbsp;logging professional? Instead of trying to find the solution
like a needle in the haystack, talk to the team that brought rsyslog,
phpLogCon, the Windows MonitorWare products and other logging
solutions. We sweat logging for over 15 years now and can help quickly.
Depending on your needs, consulting can be carried out via email, the
phone or on your premises (for larger or local projects). Everything is
possible, it just depends on your needs. Consulting services are
available in English and German. Just mail <a href="mailto:sales@adiscon.com">sales@adiscon.com</a> what you are interested in and we will work with you on a proposal that fits your needs.
