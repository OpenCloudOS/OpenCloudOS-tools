<h1>Unix Socket Input</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imuxsock</b></p>
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards
&lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p><b>Provides the ability to accept syslog messages via local Unix
sockets. Most importantly, this is the mechanism by which the syslog(3)
call delivers syslog messages to rsyslogd.</b> So you need to have this
module loaded to read the system log socket and be able to process log
messages from applications running on the local system.</p>
<p><b>Application-provided
timestamps are ignored by default.</b> This is needed, as some programs
(e.g. sshd) log with inconsistent timezone information, what
messes up the local logs (which by default don't even contain time zone
information). This seems to be consistent with what sysklogd did for
the past four years. Alternate behaviour may be desirable if
gateway-like processes send messages via the local log slot - in this
case, it can be enabled via the
$InputUnixListenSocketIgnoreMsgTimestamp and $SystemLogSocketIgnoreMsgTimestamp config directives</p>
<p><b>Unix log sockets can be flow-controlled.</b> That is, if processing queues fill up,
the unix socket reader is blocked for a short while. This may be useful to prevent overruning
the queues (which may cause exessive disk-io where it actually would not be needed). However,
flow-controlling a log socket (and especially the system log socket) can lead to a very
unresponsive system. As such, flow control is disabled by default. That means any log records
are places as quickly as possible into the processing queues. If you would like to have
flow control, you need to enable it via the $SystemLogSocketFlowControl and
$InputUnixListenSocketFlowControl config directives. Just make sure you thought about
the implications. Note that for many systems, turning on flow control does not hurt.
<p><b>Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>$InputUnixListenSocketIgnoreMsgTimestamp</b> [<b>on</b>/off]
<br>Ignore timestamps included in the message. Applies to the next socket being added.</li>
<li><b>$InputUnixListenSocketFlowControl</b> [on/<b>off</b>] - specifies if flow control should be applied
to the next socket.</li>
<li><b>$SystemLogSocketIgnoreMsgTimestamp</b> [<b>on</b>/off]<br>
Ignore timestamps included in the messages, applies to messages received via the system log socket.</li>
<li><b>$OmitLocalLogging</b> (imuxsock) [on/<b>off</b>] -- former -o option</li>
<li><b>$SystemLogSocketName</b> &lt;name-of-socket&gt; -- former -p option</li>
<li><b>$SystemLogFlowControl</b> [on/<b>off</b>] - specifies if flow control should be applied
to the system log socket.</li>
<li><b>$AddUnixListenSocket</b> &lt;name-of-socket&gt; adds additional unix socket, default none -- former -a option</li>
<li><b>$InputUnixListenSocketHostName</b> &lt;hostname&gt; permits to override the hostname that
shall be used inside messages taken from the <b>next</b> $AddUnixListenSocket socket. Note that
the hostname must be specified before the $AddUnixListenSocket configuration directive, and it
will only affect the next one and then automatically be reset. This functionality is provided so
that the local hostname can be overridden in cases where that is desired.</li>
</ul>
<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b><br>
<br>
This documentation is sparse and incomplete.
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p>The following sample is the minimum setup required to accept syslog messages from applications running on the local system.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="2" cols="70">$ModLoad imuxsock # needs to be done just once
$SystemLogSocketFlowControl on # enable flow control (use if needed)
</textarea>
<p>The following sample is a configuration where rsyslogd pulls logs from two
jails, and assigns different hostnames to each of the jails: </p>
<textarea rows="6" cols="60">$ModLoad imuxsock # needs to be done just once

$InputUnixListenSocketHostName jail1.example.net
$AddUnixListenSocket /jail/1/dev/log
$InputUnixListenSocketHostName jail2.example.net
$AddUnixListenSocket /jail/2/dev/log
