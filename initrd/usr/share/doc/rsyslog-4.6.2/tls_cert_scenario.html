<h3>Sample Scenario</h3>
<p>We have a quite simple scenario. There is one central syslog server, 
<span style="float: left">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-3204610807458280";
/* rsyslog doc inline */
google_ad_slot = "5958614527";
google_ad_width = 125;
google_ad_height = 125;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
</span>
named central.example.net. These server is being reported to by two Linux 
machines with name zuse.example.net and turing.example.net. Also, there is a 
third client - ada.example.net - which send both its own messages to the central 
server but also forwards messages receive from an UDP-only capable router. We 
hav decided to use ada.example.net because it is in the same local network 
segment as the router and so we enjoy TLS' security benefits for forwarding the 
router messages inside the corporate network. All systems (except the router) use
<a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/">rsyslog</a> as the syslog software.</p>

<p>Please note that the CA must not necessarily be connected to the rest of the
network. Actually, it may be considered a security plus if it is not. If the CA
is reachable via the regular network, it should be sufficiently secured (firewal
rules et al). Keep in mind that if the CA's security is breached, your overall
system security is breached.
<p>In case the CA is compromised, you need to regenerate the CA's certificate as well
as all individual machines certificates.
