<p>If you followed the steps outlined in this documentation set, you now have

a reasonable (for most needs) secure setup for the following environment:
<center><img src="tls_cert_100.jpg"></center>
<p>You have learned about the security decisions involved and which we
made in this example. <b>Be once again reminded that you must make sure yourself
that whatever you do matches your security needs!</b> There is no guarantee that
what we generally find useful actually is. It may even be totally unsuitable for
your environment.
<p>In the example, we created a rsyslog certificate authority (CA). Guard the CA's
files. You need them whenever you need to create a new machine certificate. We also saw how
to generate the machine certificates themselfs and distribute them to the individual
machines. Also, you have found some configuration samples for a sever, a client and
a syslog relay. Hopefully, this will enable you to set up a similar system in many
environments.
<p>Please be warned that you defined some expiration dates for the certificates.
After they are reached, the certificates are no longer valid and rsyslog will NOT
accept them. At that point, syslog messages will no longer be transmitted (and rsyslogd
will heavily begin to complain). So it is a good idea to make sure that you renew the
certificates before they expire. Recording a reminder somewhere is probably a good
idea.
<p>If you have any more questions, please visit the <a href="http://kb.monitorware.com/rsyslog-f40.html">rsyslog forum</a> and simply ask ;)
