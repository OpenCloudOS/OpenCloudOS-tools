<h1>Mail Output Module (ommail)</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ommail</b></p>
<p><b>Available since:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 3.17.0</p>
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards
&lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>This module supports sending syslog messages via mail. Each
syslog message is sent via its own mail. Obviously, you will want to
apply rigorous filtering, otherwise your mailbox (and mail server) will
be heavily spammed. The ommail plugin is primarily meant for alerting
users. As such, it is assume that mails will only be sent in an
extremely limited number of cases.</p>
<p>Please note that ommail is especially well-suited to work in
tandem with <a href="imfile.html">imfile</a> to
watch files for the occurence of specific things to be alerted on. So
its scope is far broader than forwarding syslog messages to mail
recipients.</p>
Ommail uses two templates, one for the mail body and one for the
subject line. If neither is provided, a quite meaningless subject line
is used and the mail body will be a syslog message just as if it were
written to a file. It is expected that the users customizes both
messages. In an effort to support cell phones (including SMS gateways),
there is an option to turn off the body part at all. This is considered
to be useful to send a short alert to a pager-like device.<br>
<br>
It is highly recommended to use the&nbsp; "<span style="font-weight: bold;">$ActionExecOnlyOnceEveryInterval
&lt;seconds&gt;</span>" directive to limit the amount of
mails that potentially be generated. With it, mails are sent at most in
a &lt;seconds&gt; interval. This may be your life safer. And
remember that an hour has 3,600 seconds, so if you would like to
receive mails at most once every two hours, include a
"$ActionExecOnlyOnceEveryInterval 7200" immediately before the ommail
action. Messages sent more frequently are simpy discarded.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><b>Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">$ActionMailSMTPServer</span><br>
Name or IP address of the SMTP server to be used. Must currently be
set. The default is 127.0.0.1, the SMTP server on the local machine.
Obviously it is not good to expect one to be present on each machine,
so this value should be specified.<br>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">$ActionMailSMTPPort</span><br>
Port number or name of the SMTP port to be used. The default is 25, the
standard SMTP port.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">$ActionMailFrom</span><br>
The email address used as the senders address. There is no default.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">$ActionMailTo</span><br>
The recipient email addresses. There is no default. To specify multiple
recpients, repeat this directive as often as needed. Note: <b>This directive
must be specified for each new action and is automatically reset.</b> 
[Multiple recipients are supported for 3.21.2 and above.]</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">$ActionMailSubject</span><br>
The name of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">template</span>
to be used as the mail subject. If this is not specified, a more or
less meaningless mail subject is generated (we don't tell you the exact
text because that can change - if you want to have something specific,
configure it!).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">$ActionMailEnableBody</span><br>
Setting this to "off" permits to exclude the actual message body. This
may be useful for pager-like devices or cell phone SMS messages. The
default is "on", which is appropriate for allmost all cases. Turn it
off only if you know exactly what you do!</li>
</ul>
<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<p>The current ommail implementation supports <span style="font-weight: bold;">SMTP-direct mode</span>
only. In that mode, the plugin talks to the mail server via SMTP
protocol. No other process is involved. This mode offers best
reliability as it is not depending on any external entity except the
mail server. Mail server downtime is acceptable if the action is put
onto its own action queue, so that it may wait for the SMTP server to
come back online. However, the module implements only the bare SMTP
essentials. Most importantly, it does not provide any authentication
capabilities. So your mail server must be configured to accept incoming
mail from ommail without any authentication needs (this may be change
in the future as need arises, but you may also be referred to
sendmail-mode).</p>
<p>In theory, ommail should also offer a mode where it uses the
sendmail utility to send its mail (<span style="font-weight: bold;">sendmail-mode</span>).
This is somewhat less reliable (because we depend on an entity we do
not have close control over - sendmail). It also requires dramatically
more system ressources, as we need to load the external process (but
that should be no problem given the expected infrequent number of calls
into this plugin). The big advantage of sendmail mode is that it
supports all the bells and whistles of a full-blown SMTP implementation
and may even work for local delivery without a SMTP server being
present. Sendmail mode will be implemented as need arises. So if you
need it, please drop us a line (I nobody does, sendmail mode will
probably never be implemented).</p>
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p>The following sample alerts the operator if the string "hard
disk fatal failure" is present inside a syslog message. The mail server
at mail.example.net is used and the subject shall be "disk problem on
&lt;hostname&gt;". Note how \r\n is included inside the body
text
to create line breaks. A message is sent at most once every 6 hours,
any other messages are silently discarded (or, to be precise, not being
forwarded - they are still being processed by the rest of the
configuration file).<br>

<p>The sample below is the same, but sends mail to two recipients:</p>
<textarea rows="15" cols="80">$ModLoad ommail
$ActionMailSMTPServer mail.example.net
$ActionMailFrom rsyslog@example.net
$ActionMailTo operator@example.net
$ActionMailTo admin@example.net
$template mailSubject,"disk problem on %hostname%"
$template mailBody,"RSYSLOG Alert\r\nmsg='%msg%'"
$ActionMailSubject mailSubject
# make sure we receive a mail only once in six
# hours (21,600 seconds ;))
$ActionExecOnlyOnceEveryInterval 21600
# the if ... then ... mailBody mus be on one line!
if $msg contains 'hard disk fatal failure' then :ommail:;mailBody
</textarea>
