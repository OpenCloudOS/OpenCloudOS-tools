README_extra.txt for version 7.2 of Vim: Vi IMproved.

The extra archive of Vim is to be used in combination with the source archive
(vim-7.0-src.tar.gz).  The extra archive is useless without it.

For more information, see the "README.txt" file that comes with the runtime
archive (vim-7.0-rt.tar.gz).  To be able to run Vim you MUST get the runtime
archive too!

The extra archive plus the source and runtime achives make up the complete
sources of Vim for all systems.

		what Farsi is, this is not for you.
