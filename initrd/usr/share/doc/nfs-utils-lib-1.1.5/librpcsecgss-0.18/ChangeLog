2004-10-20: started

2005-03-10: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.2

	* Fix some configure issues
	* Change all error messages to go to syslog (using LOG_ERR)
	  instead of going to stderr
	* Change debugging messages so they can be turned on dynamically
	  via new function authgss_set_debug_level()  These also go to
	  syslog (using LOG_DEBUG)
	* Fix compile error on amd64 reported by
	  Chip Salzenberg <chip@pobox.com>

2005-03-11: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.3

	* Fix issues compiling with Heimdal
	* Remove include/gssapi.h and use the gssapi.h
	  that comes with Kerberos

2005-03-14: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.4

	* Clean up Kerberos configure checking

2005-03-22: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.5

	* Fix problem with older MIT releases that do not
	  define RFC-defined names such as GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE

2005-07-29: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.6

	* Fix some memory leaks
	* Change the interface for svcauth_gss_set_svc_name() to allow
	  it to be called multiple times so that a server can support
	  more than one service name.  (The svcgssd changes needed to
	  make use of this are not yet complete.)
	* Small change to not try to call getmic() until context
	  negotiation is complete.
	* Because of the interface change, bumped the library soname.

2005-12-07: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.7

	* Install rpc headers for users of this library to use
	  (Currently installed in ${prefix}/include/rpcsecgss/rpc/*.h)
	* Add pkg-config support so that other packages can find and use
	  the headers and library produced.  The pkgconfig information is
	  installed by default in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig which is not
	  searched by default by pkg-config
	* Remove dependency on knowledge of Kerberos installation
	* Don't use fixed-length buffers

2006-02-24: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.8

	* From Olga Kornievskaia -- add new prep_refresh function
	  to clean up context information before trying to refresh
	  a context
	* From Olga Kornievskaia -- add new function to access
	  retry count for a context.
	* Adds back clnt_* files which have the necessary calls
	  needed for privacy.

2006-04-01: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.9

	* Fix potential memory leak on authgss_create() failure.
	* Patch from Timo Aaltonen <tjaalton@cc.hut.fi> for
	  Debian packaging.

2006-04-04: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.10

	* Modify authgss_get_private_data() to "forget" about the
	  private data it just gave away.
	* Add new function authgss_free_private_data() to be
	  called by the caller of authgss_get_private_data()
	  to free up resources.

2006-04-14: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.11

	* Remove all unnecessary headers from this distribution and
	  instead use the headers provided by glibc.  This should
	  fix problems reported on 64-bit platforms.
	* Fix compiler errors and most warnings due to these changes.
	* Add install code to remove old versions of our headers that
	  may have been previously installed.
	* Change soname and version.  (ldconfig must be run,
	  nfs-utils must be re-built and re-linked.)

2006-05-26: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.12

	* Add function to handle xdr of gss_buffer_desc.  This
	  properly handles the size_t/u_int mismatch on 64-bit
	  platforms.

2006-06-08: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.13

	* From Olga Kornievskaia -- use prep_refresh stuff in the
	  tcp client.  (Needed for SPKM3 context negotiations.)
	* Fix SPKM3 context negotiation problem which was introduced
	  in Release 0.12.  Buffers for SPKM3 are much bigger than in
	  Kerberos, maxlength was too small while encoding gss_buffers.

2006-08-01: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.14

	* Introduce function renaming so there is no conflict with
	  functions in the glibc library.  This fixes problems when
	  NIS is used and winds up calling our function rather than
	  the glibc version of the function.

2007-09-04: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.15

	* Fix for stack overflow problem (CVE-2007-3999)
	* Change to use libgssglue rather than libgssapi.
	  This resolves a conflict with Heimdal and MIT
	  Kerberos which use the libgssapi name.

2007-09-06: Kevin Coffman <kwc@citi.umich.edu>
	Release 0.16

	* Patch from Guillaume Rousse <Guillaume.Rousse@inria.fr>
	  Fix include path to find gssglue headers.
